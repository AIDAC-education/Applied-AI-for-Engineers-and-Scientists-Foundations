## 🎯 About the Specialization

Many scientists and engineers assume AI is just machine learning and therefore study courses designed for computer science students.  
However, their professional needs are different.  
This specialization is designed specifically for **engineering and science students** to learn and apply AI techniques efficiently and effectively for **real-world engineering and scientific problems**.

Through **MATLAB toolboxes**, learners can bypass complex coding and focus on the key AI concepts and algorithms that matter in science and engineering.  
After completing this specialization, students will be able to:
- Understand and apply key algorithms in **evolutionary computation** and **machine learning**.  
- Use MATLAB’s AI functions fluently for optimization and data analysis.  
- Design and evaluate intelligent systems for engineering and research practice. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
